# COLOR MATCH GUARANTEE &trade;
*Can You Guarantee A Match?*


## High Concept

Color Match Guarantee &trade; is a fast-paced memory game in which the player must match a number of hidden colors to progress to faster and more difficult stages.

## Genre

This is a fairly casual Action Puzzle type game. It is single player, but should  allow for friendly competition between friends.

## Platform

The primary platform will be desktop given that this will be a browser based game. However, creation of a mobile friendly game is a secondary goal.

## Story

Color Match Guarantee &trade; has no defined story and is instead a simple abstract game intended for casual enjoyment in a few spare minutes.

## Aesthetics

As mentioned above, Color Match Guarantee &trade; is a simple and abstract game, consisting mostly of shapes and colors. The color schemes and fonts should be bright and evoke a sense of playful compeititon. As time runs out, the level and time remaining will begin to flash to set a more urgent pace to the game. The sounds will be equally simple, with a positive ding for making matches and a harsher alarm type sound when incorrect clicks are made. Upon succesfully finishing a level, there will be some form of positive fanfare noise.

## Gameplay

**Mechanics:** The Countdown and Hidden Information/Memorization aspects will be the primary mechanics of the game. Success will be rewarded through proceeding to more difficult levels.

**Controls:** The controls for the game will be limited to the mouse. Only the left-click button should be necessary.

**Learning the Game:** The instructions for Color Match Guarantee &trade; will be fairly simple, and presented through a popup when the game is first loaded. This will then be accessible once the game starts through an onscreeen button.

**Strategies:** The first skill that players will need to develop for success in Color Match Guarantee &trade; is obviously memorization of color pairs when they are revealed at the start of a level. As levels increase in difficulty, scanning quickly for the pairs will become a necessity, as well as potentially prioritizing which colors should be selected first, to increase efficiency. At even higher levels of difficulty, differentiating between color pairs and single colors will become important as well.

## About the Developer

My name is Patrick Geaslin, and I'm a second-year Game Design & Development major at RIT. Most of my skills related to the major are in the programming side of things, though I'm recently discovering I enjoy 3D modeling to some extent. On the side I like to read and play games, my favorite of which is Magic: The gathering.
